# IMDB-Movie-Analysis---Quiz1---Jaba Mgebrishvili
# Description:
This project aims to analyze a dataset of top 2000 IMDb movies using Python and the pandas library. The dataset provides comprehensive information about each movie, including its title, release year, genre, IMDb rating, Metascore, duration, gross earnings, etc. The goal of the analysis is to extract meaningful insights from the data, such as trends in movie ratings, popular genres, and the relationship between movie duration, Metascore and earnings.
# Files:
1. `imdb_top_2000_movies.csv` from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prishasawhney/imdb-dataset-top-2000-movies: CSV file containing the dataset of top 2000 IMDb movies.
2. `imdb_movie_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code for data analysis.
# Tasks Completed:
# 1. Data Extraction and Manipulation:
- Extracted relevant rows and columns from the dataset to focus on essential information.
- Assigned indexing to the 'Release Year' column to facilitate time-based analysis.
- Created filters based on parameters such as IMDb rating and genre to extract subsets of data.
# 2. Data Analysis:
   - Sorted the dataset based on IMDb rating and gross earnings to identify top-rated and highest-grossing movies.
   - Conducted statistical analysis on movie durations, including mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values.
   - Investigated genre-wise statistics to understand the distribution of movie durations and ratings across different genres.
# 3. Visualization:
   - Generated visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, histograms, and boxplots, to illustrate key insights from the data.
   - Used seaborn and matplotlib libraries to create visually appealing and informative plots.
   - Visualized the distribution of movie durations, IMDb ratings, and Metascores to identify patterns and outliers.
